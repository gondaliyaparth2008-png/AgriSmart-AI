Bonus Endpoint — GenAI Farmer Guidance & Explanation Assistant

POST /api/v1/assistant/query
    • Accepts a farmer's natural-language question, preferred language,
      and optional grounding context (e.g. detected disease class).
    • Returns a structured, farmer-friendly response with follow-up
      questions and source citations.

AI Backend
----------
Primary:  Google Gemini  (set GEMINI_API_KEY in .env)
Fallback: Built-in rule-based mock engine (no API key needed)

The response schema (AssistantResponse) is backend-agnostic — the frontend
integration is identical regardless of which engine is active.

Supported languages

English (en), Hindi (hi), Telugu (te), Tamil (ta), Kannada (kn),
Marathi (mr), Bengali (bn), Punjabi (pa), Gujarati (gu)
